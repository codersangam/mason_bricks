## Getting Started ðŸš€

To create a bloc, run the following command:

    mason make screen_helper

and enter the name of the feature

This will create the following folder structure [considering the name of the feature/screen is `profile`]:

    profile
    |
    |- -|
    |   |
    |   |- profile.dart
    |   |- profile_data.dart
    |   |- profile_imports.dart
    |- widgets
    |   |
    |   |- widgets_imports.dart
    

This brick generates compatible code for features/screens:

Thank you for using screen_helper brick!
