## Getting Started 🚀

To create a feature/screen, run the following command:

    mason make screen_helper_plus

and enter the name of the feature

This will create the following folder structure [considering the name of the feature/screen is `profile`]:

    profile
    |
    |- -|
    |- -|- models- -| 
    |- -|           |- profile_model.dart
    |- -|
    |- -|- views- -|
    |- -|          |- widgets_imports.dart
    |- -|          |- profile.i18n.dart
    |- -|          |- profile.dart     
    |- -|          |- profile_imports.dart    
    |- -|               
    |- -|- view_models-|
                       |- profile_view_model.dart
